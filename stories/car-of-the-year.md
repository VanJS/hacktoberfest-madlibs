[noun] you'll ever drive! The only four-door [noun] that
comes equipped with dual air [noun]s, power [noun]s,
and contoured, plush leather [noun]s. And, believe it or not,
it is the only car in its class that can go up to a hundred thousand
[noun]s without needing a [type of liquid] change or
a [noun] tune-up. Run, do not dance to your nearest
[last name].dealer and feast your [plural body part] on
the car that Motor [noun] magazine calls the [adjective]
