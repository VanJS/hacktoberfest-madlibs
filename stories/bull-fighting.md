Bullfighting is a one-sided sport which is very popular in
[location]. A bullfighter is called a matador, and his
equipment consists of a long, sharp [noun] called
a [spanish word], and a bright red fedora. He
waves his [clothing] at the bull, which makes the bull
[adjective] and causes him to charge. The matador then goes
through a series of [adjective] maneuvers to avoid getting
caught on the bull's [body part]. If the matador kills the
bull, the spectators yell, "[spanish word]!" and throw
their [noun]s.into the ring. If the bull wins, they yell
"[exclamation]!" and call for another matador. Bullfighting
is a very [adjective] sport, but it will never be popular to America
because Americans don't believe in cruelty to spectators.
